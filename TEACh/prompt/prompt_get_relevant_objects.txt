Explain: The task defined by the dialogue involves moving a spatula to the countertop, then slicing a tomato, then moving a mug to the surface. Objects important for this task and explicitly mentioned in the dialogue are a spatula, countertop, tomato, mug, and surface. Relevant objects for this task that are related to surface in the object list could be DiningTable, CounterTop, or Shelf. Objects not mentioned in the dialogue but would also be important for the task would be a knife for cutting the tomato. 

List: Spatula, CounterTop, Tomato, TomatoSliced, Mug, DiningTable, Shelf, Knife

**Guidelines:**
1. Use the dialogue and common sense about the task to make your list. All objects that are relevant may not be mentioned in the dialogue.
2. Be liberal in your inclusion of objects. If there is a chance it could be relevant, include the object in the list.
3. Follow the output format very strictly. Your list should start with "List: " and then list the objects separated by commas. Do not include any other output other than the explanation and relevant object list.
4. Only include objects in the object list in your list, and do not alter the object names from how they appear in the object list. For example "PepperShaker" should remain "PepperShaker" in your list without modification.
