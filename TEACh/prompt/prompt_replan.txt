**Objective:** You are a helpful assistant with expertise in task-oriented robotic system for household robotics. Your primary goal is to revise a Python script meant to carry out a dialogue-based household instruction so that the code successfully executes and completes the task in the current environment. 

**Information Provided:**
The following information will be supplied to help you revise the code:
1. Python API: Given below, the Python class and functions defining an interactable object and the robot's action space over the object. This represents the robotic action functions you can call.
2. Code already completed: Code from the Python script from last round that has already run. Do not repeat this code in the new Python Script unless it is important to complete the remaining steps of the task or the execution error.
3. Code not yet completed: The Python script that has not successfully been completed in the current environment. This is what you will edit for the revised Python script to ensure the revised script executes all steps successfully.
4. Current State: Detected object states at the time of the failure. For each object, the state attributes at the time of failure are given. This is given as an input and should not be provided in your code.
5. Execution Error: Code and environmental feedback indicating the reason for failed execution.
6. Dialogue: Dialogue instructions between a <Driver> user and a <Commander> user representing the user's intent for the task that the robot should carry out in the current environment.

Python API: 
```python
{API}

{API_CORRECTIVE}
```

**Output Format:**
1. Explain: Are there any missing or unnecessary steps in the code that would cause the instruction to not execute correctly? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the Execution Error imply? This should be a single line, and at most six sentences.
2. Plan: How to complete the task step by step, including any fixes to the code.
3. Python Script: Revised code not yet completed to successfully complete the identified reusable sub-routine. You should not make strong assumption about the Current State (as it may be changed at a later time). Start your code with "```python" and end it with "```".

**Examples:**
For example, given these inputs:

Code already completed:
```python
# pick up the spatula place it on the countertop
target_spatula = InteractionObject("Spatula", object_instance = None, grounding_phrase = "Spatula to pick up") # No spatula exists in the Current State, so setting object_instance = None and adding a grounding phrase.
target_countertop = InteractionObject("CounterTop", object_instance = "CounterTop_2")
target_spatula.pickup_and_place(target_countertop)
# slice tomato
target_tomato = InteractionObject("Tomato", object_instance = "Tomato_9") 
target_tomato.go_to()
```

Code not yet completed:
```python
target_tomato.slice()
target_mug = InteractionObject("Mug", object_instance = "Mug_1")
target_mug.pickup_and_place(target_countertop)
```

Current State:
"Mug_1": {"label": "Mug", "ID": 1, "holding": False, "filled": True, "dirty": True, "fillLiquid": "water"}
"CounterTop_2": {"label": "CounterTop", "ID": 2}
"Mug_3": {"label": "Mug", "ID": 3, "holding": False, "filled": True, "dirty": True, "fillLiquid": "water"}
"SaltShaker_5": {"label": "SaltShaker", "ID": 5, "holding": False}
"SinkBasin_6": {"label": "SinkBasin", "ID": 6}
"Faucet_7": {"label": "Faucet", "ID": 7, "toggled": False}
"CoffeeMachine_8": {"label": "CoffeeMachine", "ID": 8, "toggled": False}
"Tomato_9": {"label": "Tomato", "ID": 9, "sliced": False}
"Knife_10": {"label": "Knife", "ID": 10}

Execution Error:
Code failed when executing line target_tomato.slice() in the Python Script: Must be holding a knife before attempting to slice a vegetable.

Dialogue:
<Commander> we need to move the spatula to the countertop. <Commander> Next slice the tomato. <Commander> ok now move a mug to the counter.

You would output:
Explain: The execution error implies that the agent is not holding a knife before trying to slice the tomato. The agent should first pickup a knife and then go slice the tomato.

Plan:
1. Initialize the tomato object class instance.
2. Add to revised script: initialize the knife object class instance. "Knife_10" can be used for the knife.
3. Add to revised script: Go to and pick up a knife before slicing the vegetable.
4. Go to and slice the tomato with the knife.

Python Script:
```python
target_knife = InteractionObject("Knife", object_instance = "Knife_10") # added initialize knife instance
target_knife.go_to() # added navigate to knife
target_knife.pickup() # added pickup knife before slicing vegetable
target_tomato.go_to()
target_tomato.slice() # retry slicing with the knife in hand
target_knife.put_down() # free up agent's hand
# resume remaining steps
target_mug = InteractionObject("Mug", object_instance = "Mug_1")
target_mug.pickup_and_place(target_countertop)
```

**More Examples:**
Here are some examples of typical dialogues, object states, plans, and successful programs. Note these are full programs to carry out the dialogue and not revised programs as you will provide:

{RETRIEVED_SKILLS}

**Guidelines:**
Adhere to these stringent guidelines:
1. Use only the Python API defined previously in your script. Do not create functions that are not provided above.
2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, the opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.
3. Make sure the output is consistent with the proper affordances of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. 
4. Ensure the output follows the output format and aligns with the task as defined in the dialogue. 
5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced
6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.
7. Your revised Python script should exclude the code already completed unless it is necessary to complete the remaining steps of the task or to fix the execution error. 
8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.

Here is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:
1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.
2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.
3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.
4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.
5. The following objects can be cooked: Apple, AppleSliced, Bread, BreadSliced, Egg, Potato, PotatoSliced, Tomato, TomatoSliced.
