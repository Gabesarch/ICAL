Dialogue Instruction:
<Commander> Can you clean a mug and fill it with coffee please?
<Commander> The mug is in the fridge
<Driver> The blue machine is the coffee machine, right?
<Commander> yes that's the one
<Commander> You might need to empty or clean the mug first
<Driver> This is very bizarre, I can't interact with it at all
<Commander> is it already on?
<Driver> Apparently
<Commander> maybe switch it off and on again
<Driver> I can turn it off, but not on
<Driver> nothing happens
<Commander> is that a clean and empty mug?
<Commander> Oh that seems to have filled it
<Commander> Thank you
<Driver> I am going to wash it again
<Commander> It is full, don't worry!
<Driver> Okay
