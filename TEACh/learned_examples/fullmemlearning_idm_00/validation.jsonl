Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5. The following objects can be cooked: Apple, AppleSliced, Bread, BreadSliced, Egg, Potato, PotatoSliced, Tomato, TomatoSliced.\n\n**Task:**\nGenerate the Python script that carries out the dialogue-based instruction. \n\nHere are your inputs:\n\nCurrent State: \n\"Newspaper_4\": {\"label\": \"Newspaper\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"DiningTable\"]}\n\"Newspaper_12\": {\"label\": \"Newspaper\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CoffeeTable\"]}\n\"CoffeeTable_40\": {\"label\": \"CoffeeTable\"}\n\"DiningTable_41\": {\"label\": \"DiningTable\"}\n\n\nDialogue: \n<Driver> what do i need to do? <Commander> put all the newspaper on one furniture. \n\nYour ouput:\n\nPython Script:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\n# Define InteractionObject instances for newspapers and the selected furniture\nnewspaper_4 = InteractionObject(\"Newspaper\", object_instance=\"Newspaper_4\")\nnewspaper_12 = InteractionObject(\"Newspaper\", object_instance=\"Newspaper_12\")\nselected_furniture = InteractionObject(\"DiningTable\", object_instance=\"DiningTable_41\")  # Choosing the dining table as the furniture to consolidate newspapers\n\n# (causal abstraction) Pick up each newspaper and place it on the selected furniture\n# Move newspaper_4 to the dining table\nnewspaper_4.go_to()\nnewspaper_4.pickup()\nselected_furniture.go_to()\nnewspaper_4.place(selected_furniture)\n\n# Move newspaper_12 to the dining table\nnewspaper_12.go_to()\nnewspaper_12.pickup()\nselected_furniture.go_to()\nnewspaper_12.place(selected_furniture)\n\n# The newspapers are now consolidated on the dining table as per the Commander's instruction\n\n```"}]}

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5.

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5. The following objects can be cooked: Apple, AppleSliced, Bread, BreadSliced, Egg, Potato, PotatoSliced, Tomato, TomatoSliced.\n\n**Task:**\nGenerate the Python script that carries out the dialogue-based instruction. \n\nHere are your inputs:\n\nCurrent State: \n\"Knife_1\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Shelf\"]}\n\"Lettuce_2\": {\"label\": \"Lettuce\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Drawer\"]}\n\"Plate_10\": {\"label\": \"Plate\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Knife_12\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Cabinet\"]}\n\"Lettuce_13\": {\"label\": \"Lettuce\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Floor\", \"GarbageCan\"]}\n\"Plate_16\": {\"label\": \"Plate\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"CounterTop_24\": {\"label\": \"CounterTop\"}\n\"CounterTop_47\": {\"label\": \"CounterTop\"}\n\"Knife_49\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"Sink\"]}\n\"Bread_51\": {\"label\": \"Bread\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"cooked\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Sink\"]}\n\"Potato_54\": {\"label\": \"Potato\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"cooked\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Sink\"]}\n\"Plate_61\": {\"label\": \"Plate\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Stool\"]}\n\"WineBottle_67\": {\"label\": \"WineBottle\", \"holding\": False, \"filled\": True, \"fillLiquid\": None, \"supported_by\": [\"Sink\"]}\n\"SinkBasin_77\": {\"label\": \"SinkBasin\"}\n\"Lettuce_80\": {\"label\": \"Lettuce\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Knife_81\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Fridge\"]}\n\"Faucet_91\": {\"label\": \"Faucet\", \"toggled\": False}\n\"LettuceSliced_92\": {\"label\": \"LettuceSliced\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Plate\", \"CounterTop\"]}\n\"LettuceSliced_93\": {\"label\": \"LettuceSliced\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\n\nDialogue: \n<Commander> hello! <Driver> What shall I do today? <Commander> Get a knife and cut 2 slices of lettuce. <Driver> Can you help me find knife? <Commander> I believe it is in the sink. <Driver> Where is lettuce? <Driver> Done. <Commander> . <Commander> I\u2019m not sure.

If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1.

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5. The following objects can be cooked: Apple, AppleSliced, Bread, BreadSliced, Egg, Potato, PotatoSliced, Tomato, TomatoSliced.\n\n**Task:**\nGenerate the Python script that carries out the dialogue-based instruction. \n\nHere are your inputs:\n\nCurrent State: \n\"Mug_0\": {\"label\": \"Mug\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": True, \"filled\": False, \"fillLiquid\": None, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Mug_28\": {\"label\": \"Mug\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": False, \"filled\": False, \"fillLiquid\": None, \"supported_by\": [\"Stool\"]}\n\"CounterTop_34\": {\"label\": \"CounterTop\"}\n\"CoffeeMachine_75\": {\"label\": \"CoffeeMachine\", \"toggled\": False}\n\"SinkBasin_80\": {\"label\": \"SinkBasin\"}\n\"Mug_88\": {\"label\": \"Mug\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": False, \"filled\": False, \"fillLiquid\": None, \"supported_by\": [\"Cabinet\"]}\n\"Stool_90\": {\"label\": \"Stool\"}\n\"Faucet_91\": {\"label\": \"Faucet\", \"toggled\": True}\n\n\nDialogue: \n<Driver> hello how can I help? <Commander> please prepare a coffee in a clean mug. <Commander> the mug is on the chair. <Driver> coffee is done. <Commander> thank you that's all. <Driver> thanks. \n\nYour ouput:\n\nPython Script:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\n# Define InteractionObject instances for the mug, coffee machine, and sink basin\nchair_mug = InteractionObject(\"Mug\", object_instance=\"Mug_28\")  # Mug is on the chair\ncoffee_machine = InteractionObject(\"CoffeeMachine\", object_instance=\"CoffeeMachine_75\")  # Coffee machine to prepare coffee\nsink_basin = InteractionObject(\"SinkBasin\", object_instance=\"SinkBasin_80\")  # Sink basin for cleaning the mug if necessary\nfaucet = InteractionObject(\"Faucet\", object_instance=\"Faucet_91\")  # Faucet to use water for cleaning\ncountertop = InteractionObject(\"CounterTop\", object_instance=\"CounterTop_34\")  # Define a countertop instance to place the mug on\n\n# Pick up the specified mug from the chair\nchair_mug.go_to()\nchair_mug.pickup()\n\n# Check if the mug is clean; if not, clean the mug\nif not chair_mug.check_attribute(\"dirty\", False):\n    # If the faucet is on, turn it off before cleaning\n    if faucet.check_attribute(\"toggled\", True):\n        faucet.toggle_off()\n    \n    # Clean the mug\n    sink_basin.go_to()\n    chair_mug.place(sink_basin)\n    faucet.toggle_on()  # Rinse the mug with water\n    faucet.toggle_off()  # Turn off the faucet after rinsing\n    chair_mug.change_state(\"dirty\", False)  # Update the mug's state to clean\n\n# Use the coffee machine to prepare coffee in the clean mug\ncoffee_machine.go_to()\nchair_mug.pickup()\nchair_mug.place(coffee_machine)\ncoffee_machine.toggle_on()  # Start the coffee machine to prepare coffee\n# Wait for coffee to be prepared (this step is abstracted in the script)\ncoffee_machine.toggle_off()  # Turn off the coffee machine after coffee is prepared\nchair_mug.change_state(\"filled\", True)  # Update the mug's state to filled with coffee\nchair_mug.change_state(\"fillLiquid\", \"coffee\")  # Update the liquid in the mug to coffee\n\n# Place the mug with coffee on the countertop\nchair_mug.pickup()\nchair_mug.place(countertop)  # Correctly place the mug on the countertop\n\n# Causal abstraction comments:\n# The mug is identified on the chair and picked up to ensure we are using the correct object as per the Commander's instructions.\n# The mug's cleanliness is checked, and if necessary, it is cleaned in the sink basin to meet the requirement of using a clean mug.\n# The coffee machine is used to prepare coffee, which is the main task assigned by the Commander.\n# The mug is placed on the countertop after coffee preparation, completing the task as requested.\n\n```"}]}

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5. The following objects can be cooked: Apple, AppleSliced, Bread, BreadSliced, Egg, Potato, PotatoSliced, Tomato, TomatoSliced.\n\n**Task:**\nGenerate the Python script that carries out the dialogue-based instruction. \n\nHere are your inputs:\n\nCurrent State: \n\"Bread_1\": {\"label\": \"Bread\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": True, \"cooked\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"DiningTable\"]}\n\"Knife_2\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Fridge\"]}\n\"Lettuce_5\": {\"label\": \"Lettuce\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Fridge\"]}\n\"Plate_7\": {\"label\": \"Plate\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Knife_11\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"DiningTable\"]}\n\"Lettuce_13\": {\"label\": \"Lettuce\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Bread_14\": {\"label\": \"Bread\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"cooked\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"CounterTop_20\": {\"label\": \"CounterTop\"}\n\"DiningTable_21\": {\"label\": \"DiningTable\"}\n\"CounterTop_23\": {\"label\": \"CounterTop\"}\n\"Knife_66\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"Fridge\"]}\n\"Fridge_67\": {\"label\": \"Fridge\", \"open\": False}\n\"Plate_85\": {\"label\": \"Plate\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Lettuce_90\": {\"label\": \"Lettuce\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop_20\"]}\n\"Toaster_91\": {\"label\": \"Toaster\", \"toggled\": False}\n\"SinkBasin_92\": {\"label\": \"SinkBasin\"}\n\"Knife_96\": {\"label\": \"Knife\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"DiningTable\"]}\n\"Bread_97\": {\"label\": \"Bread\", \"holding\": False, \"sliced\": False, \"cooked\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"DiningTable\"]}\n\"Mug_102\": {\"label\": \"Mug\", \"holding\": False, \"dirty\": False, \"filled\": True, \"fillLiquid\": \"water\", \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"Faucet_104\": {\"label\": \"Faucet\", \"toggled\": False}\n\"BreadSliced_106\": {\"label\": \"BreadSliced\", \"holding\": False, \"cooked\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"BreadSliced_107\": {\"label\": \"BreadSliced\", \"holding\": False, \"cooked\": True, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"LettuceSliced_108\": {\"label\": \"LettuceSliced\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\"LettuceSliced_109\": {\"label\": \"LettuceSliced\", \"holding\": False, \"supported_by\": [\"CounterTop\"]}\n\n\nDialogue: \n<Driver> What shall I do today?

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5.

Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5.

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5.

Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4.

You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1.

Python Script: The Python script required to execute the instructions from the dialogue. Start your code with \"```python\" and end it with \"```\".\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. Use only the Python API defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.\n2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.\n3. Ensure the output aligns with the intended functions of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. \n4. The input is dialogue between <Driver> and <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.\n5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5.

Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced\n6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.\n7. If an object that is needed for the script is not in the object state, you should assign \"None\" to \"object_instance\" in the InteractionObject initialization. For example, if no apple is in the current state, but one is needed you would do: target_apple = InteractionObject(\"Apple\", object_instance = None)\n8. If an object is sliced, this will create individual slices of the object (e.g., whole potato -> many slices of potato). A new InteractionObject with parent_object argument set to the whole object instance should be instantiate to interact with a single slice of the sliced object. The sliced object InteractionObject class should only be initialized after the parent object has been sliced.\n\nHere is some additional information about the affordances of object categories to help you plan:\n1. The following objects can be filled with liquid: Bottle, Bowl, Cup, HousePlant, Kettle, Mug, Pot, WateringCan, WineBottle.\n2. The following objects can be sliced: Apple, Bread, Lettuce, Potato, Tomato.\n3. The following objects can be toggled: DeskLamp, FloorLamp, StoveKnob, Microwave, Toaster, Faucet, CoffeeMachine.\n4. The following objects can be dirtied: Bowl, ButterKnife, Cloth, Cup, DishSponge, Egg, Fork, Kettle, Knife, Ladle, Mug, Pan, Plate, Pot, SoapBar, Spatula, Spoon.\n5.
