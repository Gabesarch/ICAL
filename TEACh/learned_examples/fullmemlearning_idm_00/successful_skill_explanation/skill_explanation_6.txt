Explanation: The revised script is focused on the task of consolidating all newspapers onto one piece of furniture, as per the Commander's instruction. It removes the unnecessary interaction with the credit card and dresser from the original script, which were not relevant to the task. The revised script clearly defines InteractionObject instances for the newspapers and the selected furniture (DiningTable), and it uses comments to explain the purpose of each code block, improving readability. It also uses a consistent pattern for moving each newspaper to the dining table, which makes the script more structured and easier to understand. The revised script is more efficient and directly aligned with the task at hand, without extraneous actions.
