Explanation: The revised script is streamlined to focus solely on the task of watering the plant, as per the Commander's instruction. It eliminates unnecessary actions involving the saltshaker, lettuce, apple, and a different bowl, which were present in the original script but not relevant to the task. The revised script selects the pot already filled with water, goes to the houseplant, and performs the watering action, then updates the states of the pot and plant accordingly. It also includes a conditional check to turn off the faucet if it's on, conserving water. Additionally, the revised script is better commented, explaining each step of the process, which improves readability and understanding of the code's purpose.
