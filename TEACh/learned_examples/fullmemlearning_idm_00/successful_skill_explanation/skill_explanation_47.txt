Explanation: The revised script is more efficient as it selects the clean cup that is already filled with water, eliminating unnecessary steps such as turning the faucet on and off and placing the cup in the sink basin. This directly aligns with the Commander's instruction to water the plant by getting water into a container and pouring it onto the plant. The revised script also includes comments that provide clarity on the purpose of each action, improving readability. Additionally, it updates the state of the cup and houseplant to reflect the changes after the watering action, which was not present in the original script.
