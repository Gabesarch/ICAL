Explanation: The revised script is more specific and accurate in identifying and interacting with the dish sponges mentioned by the Commander. It uses the correct object instances for each dish sponge ("DishSponge_72" for the chair, "DishSponge_19" for the fridge, and "DishSponge_3" for the countertop) and places them directly into the sink basin, as instructed. The original script incorrectly attempts to interact with a non-existent "SoapBar" object and places a dish sponge on the countertop instead of the sink. The revised script also includes comments that improve readability and clarify the purpose of each code block, aligning the actions with the dialogue instructions. The revised script is more efficient as it directly completes the task without unnecessary interactions and is easier to understand due to the added comments.
