Explanation: The revised script is more organized and follows the Commander's instructions more closely. It starts by defining the objects involved, including the dirty mug, sink basin, and faucet, and then proceeds to turn off the faucet as instructed, which was missing in the original script. The revised script also includes the step of removing the extra apple from the sink basin before rinsing the mug, which aligns with the Commander's directive to remove extra items. The original script incorrectly attempts to pick up a non-specified "Mug" and "Apple" and places the apple on an unspecified countertop, which could lead to errors. Additionally, the revised script updates the mug's state to reflect that it is clean and filled with water after rinsing, which was not done in the original script. Finally, the revised script places the mug beside the basin as instructed, which was not included in the original script. The revised script is better commented, improving readability and making it easier to understand the sequence of actions and their purpose.
