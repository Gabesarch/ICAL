Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. The original script contains irrelevant actions, such as picking up a soap bar and placing it on a sofa, and interacting with a coffee table, which are not part of the dialogue instructions. The revised script correctly focuses on the task of moving all remote controls to the chair near the dining table and checking the drawers under the TV. It introduces clear comments, uses the correct object instances for the remote controls and the chair, and includes the necessary actions to check the drawers. The revised script is more efficient, as it directly addresses the tasks mentioned in the dialogue, and it is better structured and commented for readability, making it easier to understand the sequence of actions and their purpose.
