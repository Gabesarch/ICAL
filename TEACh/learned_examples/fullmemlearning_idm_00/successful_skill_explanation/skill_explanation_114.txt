Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. The original script contains several errors and irrelevant actions, such as attempting to place a non-existent object (None.place) and interacting with a "Statue" object that is not part of the task. The revised script corrects these mistakes by removing the irrelevant actions and focusing solely on the task of moving tissue boxes to the coffee table. It introduces clear variable names for each tissue box and the target coffee table, making the code more readable. The revised script also includes comments that describe each step, improving readability and understanding of the code's purpose. Additionally, the revised script follows a consistent pattern for each tissue box: go to the box, pick it up, go to the coffee table, and place it there, which streamlines the process and ensures that all tissue boxes are moved to the correct location as per the Commander's instruction.
