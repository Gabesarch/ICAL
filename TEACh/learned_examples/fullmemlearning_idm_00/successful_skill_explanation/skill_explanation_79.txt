Explanation: The revised script is more detailed and explicit in its actions, improving readability and maintainability. It includes comments that describe each step of the process, making it easier to understand the purpose of each code block. The revised script also includes additional steps such as closing the fridge after retrieving the potato, which was missing in the original script. It specifies the instance of each object (e.g., "Fridge_61" and "Potato_54"), ensuring the correct objects are interacted with, and it selects a clean pot ("Pot_16") to use for boiling. The revised script also includes the step of turning on the stove burner to boil the potato, which is necessary for the task but was omitted in the original script. Finally, it updates the potato's state to "cooked" after boiling, which completes the task as per the dialogue instruction.
