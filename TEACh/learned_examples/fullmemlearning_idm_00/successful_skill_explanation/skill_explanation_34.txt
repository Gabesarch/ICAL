Explanation: The revised script is significantly more detailed and robust than the original. It includes checks for the mug's cleanliness and the faucet's state, cleaning the mug if necessary, and using the specified mug on the chair as directed by the Commander. The original script lacks these checks and attempts to place an undefined mug instance into the coffee machine, which would not fulfill the task requirements. The revised script also includes comments that explain each step, improving readability and understanding of the program's flow. Additionally, the revised script ensures the coffee is prepared in the coffee machine and places the filled mug on the countertop, completing the task as instructed.
