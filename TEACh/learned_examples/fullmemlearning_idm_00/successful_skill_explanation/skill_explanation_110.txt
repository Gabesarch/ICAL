Explanation: The revised script introduces several improvements for efficiency and readability. It adds conditional checks to ensure actions are only taken when necessary, such as turning off the faucet only if it's on, and pouring out liquid from the mug only if it's filled. It also updates the mug's state to reflect changes after actions like pouring out liquid and rinsing. The revised script includes comments that explain the purpose of each block of code, enhancing readability and understanding of the task flow. Additionally, the revised script removes redundant calls to `go_to()` for the faucet and `place()` for the mug, streamlining the task execution. The use of descriptive variable names and structured comments provides clarity on the task being performed and the reasoning behind each step, aligning with the Commander's instructions to clean the mug efficiently.
