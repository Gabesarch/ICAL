Explanation: The revised script is more structured and includes detailed comments explaining each step, which improves readability and maintainability. It removes unnecessary interactions with a lettuce object that were present in the original script, focusing solely on the task of cleaning the bowl as per the dialogue instructions. The revised script also adds steps for using the dish sponge and soap bottle to clean the bowl, which were missing in the original script, and updates the bowl's state to reflect the cleaning process. Additionally, it includes the rinsing step with the faucet and places the clean bowl back on the countertop, which aligns with the task completion as instructed by the Commander. The revised script is more efficient as it directly addresses the task at hand without extraneous actions and provides a clear, step-by-step process for cleaning the dishware.
