Explanation: The revised script is significantly more detailed and precise than the original demonstration script. It defines individual InteractionObject instances for each tissue box and specifies the exact object instances by their unique identifiers (e.g., "TissueBox_2", "TissueBox_6", "TissueBox_17"), ensuring that the correct objects are interacted with. The selected coffee table is also explicitly defined with its identifier ("CoffeeTable_47"). The revised script includes a step-by-step process for moving each tissue box to the selected coffee table, with clear comments explaining each action, which improves readability and maintainability. The original script lacks specificity, does not reference the correct object instances, and is missing the necessary steps to move all tissue boxes to one coffee table, making it incomplete and unable to fulfill the Commander's instruction efficiently. The revised script corrects these issues and adds comments for clarity, making it a more efficient and readable program for carrying out the task.
