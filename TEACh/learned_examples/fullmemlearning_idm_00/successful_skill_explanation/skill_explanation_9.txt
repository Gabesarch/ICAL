Explanation: The revised script is significantly streamlined and better organized compared to the original demonstration script. It removes unnecessary actions such as opening and closing cabinets, placing bread in a bowl, and handling a salt shaker, which are not relevant to the task of making a sandwich. The revised script focuses on the essential steps: slicing the bread, toasting it, slicing the tomato, checking if the plate is clean, and assembling the sandwich. It also introduces checks for the cleanliness of the plate and updates the state of the bread to 'cooked' after toasting, which were missing in the original script. Additionally, the revised script is well-commented, explaining each step of the process, which improves readability and understanding of the code. The use of descriptive variable names for the InteractionObject instances also enhances clarity.
