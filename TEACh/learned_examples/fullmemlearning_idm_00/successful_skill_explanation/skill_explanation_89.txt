Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable as it directly interacts with the specified mug in the dust bin ("Mug_15"), whereas the original script incorrectly attempts to interact with a mug from the fridge. The revised script includes a check for the mug's cleanliness, which aligns with the Commander's instruction for a clean mug, though the actual cleaning steps are abstracted. It also correctly interacts with the coffee machine to prepare coffee, updating the mug's state to reflect that it is filled with coffee. The revised script is well-commented, explaining each step and the rationale behind it, which improves readability and understanding of the task flow. The original script's redundant actions, such as opening and closing the fridge and placing the mug multiple times, are removed in the revised script, streamlining the process.
