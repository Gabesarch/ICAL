Explanation: The revised script is significantly more structured and organized, with clear comments explaining each step of the process, which improves readability and maintainability. It uses specific object instances (e.g., "Bread_42" and "Tomato_65") that are relevant to the task, as indicated by the dialogue instructions, ensuring that the correct items are interacted with. The revised script also includes the necessary steps to toast the bread slices and assemble the sandwich with tomato slices on a plate, directly following the Commander's instructions. It removes unnecessary actions and focuses on the task at hand, which is to make two slices of toast, cut two slices of tomato, and assemble a sandwich on a plate. The use of causal abstraction comments provides a high-level understanding of the task flow, contributing to the script's efficiency and clarity.
