Explanation: The revised script is more focused and efficient, as it directly addresses the Commander's instructions to move all eggs to the dining table. It removes unnecessary interactions with a drawer and a wine bottle that were present in the original script, which were not relevant to the task. The revised script also corrects object instances to match the initial object state, such as specifying the correct fridge instance ("Fridge_71") and using the correct egg instances ("Egg_19", "Egg_52", "Egg_21", "Egg_17"). Additionally, the revised script includes comments that explain the purpose of each step, improving readability and making the script easier to understand. It also closes the fridge after removing the eggs, which was not done in the original script.
