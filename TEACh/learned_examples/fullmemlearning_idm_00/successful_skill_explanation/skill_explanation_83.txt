Explanation: The revised script is more specific and accurate in identifying the correct objects to interact with, as it uses the exact object instances "TissueBox_3" for the tissue box and "DiningTable_25" for the dining table, aligning with the Commander's instructions. The original script incorrectly references a generic "TissueBox" and "SideTable" without specific instances, which could lead to the robot interacting with the wrong objects. Additionally, the revised script includes comments for clarity and uses the "go_to()" method before "pickup()" and "place()", ensuring the robot navigates to the correct locations before performing actions. The original script lacks these navigational steps and comments, making it less clear and potentially less effective. The revised script also removes the redundant "pickup_and_place()" method, which was not necessary since the "pickup()" and "place()" methods are used separately. Overall, the revised script is more precise, better commented, and follows the dialogue instructions more accurately.
