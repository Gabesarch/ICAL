Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. The original script contains irrelevant actions, such as interacting with a "SoapBar" and a "Sofa," which are not mentioned in the dialogue instructions. It also incorrectly references a "CoffeeTable" and performs redundant actions with a generic "Chair" object. The revised script is more efficient and task-focused, as it only includes actions related to picking up the specified remote controls and placing them on the designated chair near the dining table, which is correctly identified as "Chair_38." Additionally, the revised script includes the steps to check the drawers under the TV, as instructed in the dialogue, which were missing in the original script. The revised script is also better structured and commented, improving readability and making it clear what each block of code is intended to do. Overall, the revised script aligns with the dialogue instructions, removes irrelevant actions, and adds necessary steps to complete the task efficiently.
