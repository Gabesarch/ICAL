Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. It introduces clear comments that explain each step of the process, improving readability and understanding. The revised script correctly identifies and uses specific object instances (e.g., "Knife_11", "Bread_1", "Toaster_91") instead of generic labels, ensuring the robot interacts with the correct items. It also removes unnecessary actions, such as toggling the faucet off when it was not mentioned as being on, and it includes conditional checks for the plate's cleanliness before cleaning it. The slicing of lettuce is added to the revised script, which was missing in the original, and the script now includes the correct sequence of toasting two slices of bread and placing them on a plate, as per the dialogue instructions. The revised script also abstracts away the waiting time for toasting and cleaning, which would be handled by the robot's internal processes. Overall, the revised script is more efficient, accurate to the task requirements, and easier to follow due to the structured comments and correct sequence of actions.
