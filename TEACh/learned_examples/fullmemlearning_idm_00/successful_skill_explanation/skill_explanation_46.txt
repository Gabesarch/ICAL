Explanation: The revised script is focused solely on the task of boiling the potato, as per the dialogue instruction, and removes all unrelated actions such as moving the paper towel roll, mug, coffee machine, plate, egg, and pan. It introduces a check to ensure the pot is filled with water before boiling the potato, which is a necessary step for the task. The revised script also includes comments for clarity, explaining each step of the process, and uses causal abstraction to describe the actions, improving readability and making the script more efficient by eliminating unnecessary steps.
