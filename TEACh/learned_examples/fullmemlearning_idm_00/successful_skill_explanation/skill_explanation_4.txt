Explanation: The revised script is significantly streamlined and focused on the task of making a plate of toast, as per the dialogue instruction. It removes unnecessary interactions with objects not related to the task, such as lettuce, spoon, cup, saltshaker, egg, and fork, which were present in the original script. The revised script includes comments for clarity, uses conditional checks to ensure the toaster is on and the plate is clean, and properly initializes a new InteractionObject for a slice of bread. It also simulates the toasting process and updates the bread's state to 'cooked' once toasted. The revised script is more efficient and readable, directly addressing the task at hand without extraneous steps.
