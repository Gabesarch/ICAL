Explanation: The revised script is significantly streamlined and focused on the tasks specified in the dialogue, which are toasting bread, slicing a tomato, and assembling the components on a plate. It removes unnecessary actions such as interacting with a salt shaker, apple, and soap bottle, which are not mentioned in the dialogue. The revised script also includes comments that explain the purpose of each section, improving readability and understanding of the code. It uses the correct object instances for the bread, tomato, and lettuce as indicated by their locations in the dialogue, and it follows the sequence of actions as directed by the Commander, ensuring the task is carried out efficiently. Additionally, the revised script includes causal abstraction comments that explain the reasoning behind the sequence of actions, which helps to understand the high-level goals of the script.
