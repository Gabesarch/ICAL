Explanation: The revised script is more specific and efficient than the original. It defines InteractionObject instances for each remote control by their unique identifiers and selects a specific chair for placement. The revised script includes comments for clarity and follows the Commander's instructions to place all remote controls on a chair, whereas the original script lacks specificity and attempts to place a remote on a sofa, which is not requested. The revised script also removes unnecessary navigation to the chair for the second remote control placement, as the robot is already at the chair, optimizing the task execution.
