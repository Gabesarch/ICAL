Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions such as interacting with a chair and a countertop, which are not relevant to the task. The revised script specifically identifies the two candles by their instance names and the coffee table where they need to be placed, ensuring clarity in the task execution. It also includes comments that describe each step, improving readability and understanding of the code's purpose. The revised script directly addresses the Commander's instruction to place both candles on a single coffee table, which is achieved through clear and concise commands.
