Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. The original script only included picking up the pot and placing it in the sink basin, which does not fulfill the task of watering the houseplant. The revised script, however, includes a series of actions that directly address the Commander's request to water the plant: it selects the pot filled with water, navigates to the pot, picks it up, goes to the houseplant, pours water into the houseplant, and updates the states of both the pot and the houseplant to reflect the action. Additionally, the revised script checks if the faucet is on and turns it off if necessary, which is a thoughtful addition to prevent water wastage. The revised script is also well-commented, explaining each step of the process, which improves readability and understanding of the code's purpose.
