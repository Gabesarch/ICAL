Explanation: The revised script is more detailed and explicit, including steps to open and close the fridge, and specifying which instances of objects to interact with by using their unique identifiers. It also adds the step of placing the pot on the stove burner and turning on the burner to boil the potato, which were missing in the original script. The revised script improves readability by adding comments that describe each step and the rationale behind them, enhancing the understanding of the task flow. Additionally, it updates the potato's state to 'cooked' to reflect the task's completion, which was not present in the original script.
