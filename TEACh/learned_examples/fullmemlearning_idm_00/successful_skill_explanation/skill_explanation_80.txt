Explanation: The revised script adds comments for clarity, specifying the purpose of each block of code, which improves readability. It also includes additional steps to update the state of both the pot and the houseplant after the watering action, reflecting the change in their 'filled' and 'fillLiquid' attributes. These updates ensure the script accurately represents the state of the environment after the task is completed, which was not present in the original script. The object instance identifiers are also more descriptive in the revised script, enhancing understandability.
