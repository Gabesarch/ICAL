Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions, such as slicing a potato and moving a soap bottle, which are not relevant to the task of making toast. The revised script correctly identifies and interacts with the objects specified in the dialogue, such as picking up the knife from the sink and using the toaster to toast the bread. It also includes comments that explain the purpose of each step, improving readability and understanding of the script's flow. The revised script follows the dialogue instructions more closely by focusing solely on making a plate of toast with one slice and checking the sink for a knife, rather than including unrelated actions.
