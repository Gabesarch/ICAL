Explanation: The revised script is more specific and accurate in referencing object instances, such as using "Knife_68" instead of the generic "Knife" and "Lettuce_70" instead of "Lettuce". It also removes unnecessary actions, like picking up and placing a bowl, which was not part of the dialogue instructions. The revised script includes comments for clarity and readability, and it follows the dialogue instructions more closely by opening the correct cabinet ("Cabinet_21") to retrieve the plate. Additionally, the revised script directly initializes two lettuce slices without placing them on the countertop first, streamlining the process of placing the slices on the plate. Overall, the revised script is more efficient, adheres to the task requirements, and is easier to understand due to the added comments.
