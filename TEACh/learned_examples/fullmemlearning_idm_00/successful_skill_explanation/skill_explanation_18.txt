Explanation: The revised script is significantly more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions, such as toggling the microwave without reason, placing objects like the bottle and soap bottle on the countertop, and interacting with the sink basin without cleaning anything. It also adds checks for the state of objects, like verifying if the microwave is on before toggling it off and checking if the plate is dirty before cleaning it. The revised script follows the dialogue instructions more closely, focusing on slicing the tomato and potato, cooking a potato slice, and cleaning a plate before assembling the salad. It also introduces comments for clarity, organizes the steps logically, and uses the correct object instances as per the initial state, enhancing readability and maintainability.
