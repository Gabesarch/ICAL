The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original demonstration script. It directly addresses the tasks outlined in the dialogue, such as retrieving the knife from the fridge, slicing the lettuce and tomato, and placing them on a plate. The revised script removes unnecessary actions, like handling a pen and pouring from a bowl, which are not relevant to the task. It also includes comments that explain the purpose of each step, improving readability and providing a clear causal abstraction of the robot's actions. The revised script ensures that the tomato's state is updated immediately after slicing, and it checks if the plate is dirty before cleaning it, which aligns with the task requirements. Overall, the revised script is more focused on the task, avoids irrelevant actions, and is better documented.
