Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions such as interacting with lettuce and a faucet, which are not relevant to making toast. The revised script also uses the correct object instances, such as "Knife_152" from the fridge and "Bread_17" from the countertop, aligning with the dialogue instructions. It includes comments that describe each step, improving readability and understanding of the task flow. Additionally, the revised script correctly handles the toasting process by toggling the toaster on and off and updates the bread's state to "cooked" to represent the toast being ready. The causal abstraction comments at the end provide a clear summary of the task and the actions taken to complete it.
