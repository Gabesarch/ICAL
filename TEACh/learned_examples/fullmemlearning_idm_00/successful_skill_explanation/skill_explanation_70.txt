Explanation: The revised script is significantly more efficient and readable than the original demonstration script. It removes unnecessary interactions with objects not relevant to the task, such as the pepper shaker and egg, and focuses solely on the mugs, sink, and coffee machine as per the dialogue instructions. The revised script also includes conditional checks to ensure actions are only taken when necessary, such as checking if the mug is dirty before washing and if the faucet is on before turning it off. Additionally, the revised script is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each step and the reasoning behind conditional checks, which improves readability and understanding of the code's intent. The revised script also correctly identifies the mug on the stool by the toaster, as specified in the dialogue, and updates the mug's state to reflect that it is filled with coffee after using the coffee machine, which aligns with the final steps of the task.
