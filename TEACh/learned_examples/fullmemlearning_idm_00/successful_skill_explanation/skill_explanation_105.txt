Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. It introduces a structured and commented approach to the task of making a sandwich, which includes toasting bread, cleaning a plate, and adding lettuce. The revised script removes unnecessary actions, such as multiple go_to() and slice() calls on the bread, and instead focuses on toasting two slices of bread, cleaning a plate, and adding a slice of lettuce to the sandwich. It also adds comments to explain the purpose of each step, improving readability and maintainability. The revised script uses the state of objects to avoid redundant actions, such as toggling the toaster on and off for each slice of bread, and it ensures the plate is cleaned before assembling the sandwich. Additionally, the revised script uses the parent_object attribute to create new instances of sliced bread and lettuce, which is more efficient and aligns with the dialogue instructions. Overall, the revised script is more efficient, readable, and closely follows the user's intent as expressed in the dialogue.
