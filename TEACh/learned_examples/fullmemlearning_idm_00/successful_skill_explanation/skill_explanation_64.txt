Explanation: The revised script is more specific and accurate in its execution of the task. It defines two distinct InteractionObject instances for the remote controls based on their initial locations, one on the dining table and one in the garbage can, and places them on the correct target, the sofa, as per the Commander's instructions. The original script incorrectly attempts to place the remote controls on a chair and does not differentiate between the two remote controls or their initial locations. Additionally, the revised script includes comments that improve readability and clarify the intent of each code block, making it easier to understand the sequence of actions and their purpose. The revised script also removes redundant calls to `pickup_and_place` and `go_to` that were not necessary for the task.
