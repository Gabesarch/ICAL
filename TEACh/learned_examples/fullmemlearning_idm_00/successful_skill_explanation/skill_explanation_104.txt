Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. It is more structured, with clear comments explaining each step, which improves readability. The revised script correctly identifies and uses the specific instances of objects (e.g., "Knife_55", "Lettuce_49", "Tomato_53", "Plate_56") instead of generic labels like "Knife" or "Plate", ensuring the robot interacts with the correct items. It also includes logic to check if the plate is dirty and clean it if necessary, which aligns with the dialogue instruction to use a clean plate. The revised script removes irrelevant actions such as interacting with a spatula and a remote control, which were not part of the task. It also correctly handles the slicing of lettuce and tomato, placing two slices of lettuce and one slice of tomato onto the plate, as per the Commander's instructions. Overall, the revised script is more efficient, task-focused, and easier to understand.
