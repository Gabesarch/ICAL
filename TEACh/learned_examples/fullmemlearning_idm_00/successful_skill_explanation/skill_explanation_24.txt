Explanation: The revised script is more concise and directly addresses the Commander's instructions. It removes unnecessary actions such as moving the potato to the countertop, opening the stool and cabinets, closing the fridge, and handling the saltshaker and cup, which were not part of the Commander's instructions. The revised script also corrects the object instances to match the Initial Object State, uses the correct object instances for the potato and tomato in the sink, and adds a check for the bowl's cleanliness before cleaning it. Additionally, the revised script includes comments for clarity and better readability, and it organizes the actions in the order given by the Commander, improving the efficiency of the task execution.
