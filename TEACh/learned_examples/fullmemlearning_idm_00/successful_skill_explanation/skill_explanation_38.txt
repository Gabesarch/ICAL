Explanation: The revised script introduces several improvements for efficiency and readability. It starts by defining InteractionObject instances for the faucet, sink basin, and countertop, which organizes the code and makes it clear what objects are being interacted with. The script then checks if the faucet is toggled on and turns it off to conserve water, which is a more efficient use of resources. It also introduces a loop to clean all dirty plates, rather than just one, fulfilling the task of cleaning all plates as per the dialogue instruction. The revised script includes comments that explain the purpose of each code block, enhancing readability and understanding of the script's flow. Additionally, the revised script uses the `check_attribute` method to only clean plates that are dirty, which is more efficient than cleaning plates that are already clean. Overall, the revised script is more efficient, readable, and aligns better with the task of cleaning all dirty plates as instructed by the Commander.
