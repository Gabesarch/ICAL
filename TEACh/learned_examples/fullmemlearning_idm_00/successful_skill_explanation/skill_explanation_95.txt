Explanation: The revised script introduces several checks and actions that were not present in the original script. It checks if the pot contains an egg and removes it if necessary, cleans the pot if it's dirty, and updates the state of both the houseplant and the pot after watering. Additionally, it places the empty pot back on the countertop and ensures the faucet is turned off if it was left on. These changes ensure the task is completed correctly and the environment is left in order. The revised script also includes comments for better readability and understanding of each step in the process.
