Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and organized, focusing solely on cleaning the dirty plates and mug, as per the dialogue instructions. It removes unnecessary actions such as toggling the faucet multiple times, moving unrelated objects (lettuce, bottle, paper towel roll, knife, vase, fork, soap bottle), and repeatedly placing the same objects on the countertop. The revised script uses a loop to iterate over a list of dirty dishes, ensuring that only dirty items are cleaned, and it conservatively manages water usage by turning the faucet off when not in use. Additionally, the revised script includes comments that explain the purpose of each code block, improving readability and maintainability. It also corrects the InteractionObject instance for the mug and updates the state of the mug to reflect that it remains filled with water after cleaning.
