Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions such as toggling the microwave, opening the fridge, and moving pots and pans, which are not relevant to the task. The revised script directly accesses the microwave to retrieve the lettuce, uses the knife from the countertop to slice it, and places the slice on a clean plate from the specified cabinet. It also includes comments that explain the purpose of each step, improving readability and understanding of the task flow. The revised script aligns closely with the dialogue instructions, focusing only on the actions required to complete the task.
