Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. The original script contains irrelevant actions, such as picking up a soap bar and placing it on a sofa, and interacting with a coffee table, which are not part of the task described in the dialogue. The revised script is focused on the task of moving all remote controls to a specific chair near the dining table and checking the drawers under the TV. It introduces clear comments that describe the purpose of each code block, improving readability. The revised script also uses the correct object instances for the remote controls and the chair, and it includes the necessary steps to check the drawers, which were not present in the original script. Overall, the revised script is more efficient, task-focused, and easier to understand due to better structure and commenting.
