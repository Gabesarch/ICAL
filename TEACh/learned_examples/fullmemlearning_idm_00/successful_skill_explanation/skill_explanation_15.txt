Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions, such as moving a paper towel roll and closing an unspecified cabinet, which are not relevant to the task of boiling a potato. The revised script also uses specific object instances that match the dialogue instructions, ensuring the correct potato and pot are used. It includes comments that describe each step, improving readability and understanding of the code's purpose. Additionally, the revised script includes a step to turn on the stove burner, which is necessary for boiling the potato, and updates the potato's state to "cooked" to reflect the task's completion.
