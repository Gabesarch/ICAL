Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. The original script incorrectly attempts to use a plate to make coffee, which is not aligned with the dialogue instruction to make coffee using a mug. The revised script correctly identifies and interacts with the mug, cabinet, sink basin, faucet, and coffee machine as per the dialogue instructions. It includes conditional checks to ensure the mug is clean and empty before making coffee, which were not present in the original script. The revised script also includes detailed comments explaining each step of the process, improving readability and providing a clear understanding of the task flow, which the original script lacks. Additionally, the revised script includes the necessary steps to prepare coffee, such as toggling the coffee machine on and off, and placing the mug on the countertop after the coffee is made, completing the task as requested by the Commander.
