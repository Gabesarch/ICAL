Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions, such as opening and closing cabinets that are not relevant to the task, and focuses solely on the objects mentioned in the dialogue instructions. The revised script also includes comments that explain each step of the process, enhancing readability and providing context for the actions taken. Additionally, the revised script uses the correct object instances as specified in the initial object state, ensuring that the robot interacts with the right objects. It also corrects the sequence of actions to match the dialogue instructions, such as slicing the lettuce and potato, cooking the potato slice, and cleaning the plate before assembling the salad. The revised script represents a direct and clear translation of the Commander's instructions into robotic actions, with an emphasis on causal abstraction and task relevance.
