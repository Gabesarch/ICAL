Explanation: The revised script is more detailed and accurate, reflecting the dialogue instructions to boil a specific potato located to the left of the fridge. It includes steps to navigate to and pick up the correct potato, find a clean pot filled with water, place the potato in the pot, navigate to the stove burner, place the pot on it, and toggle the stove burner on to boil the potato. The revised script also updates the potato's state to "cooked" after boiling, which was missing in the original script. Additionally, the revised script is well-commented, enhancing readability and understanding of each step in the process. The original script was incomplete and lacked specificity, as it did not specify which potato or pot to interact with, nor did it include the steps to actually boil the potato.
