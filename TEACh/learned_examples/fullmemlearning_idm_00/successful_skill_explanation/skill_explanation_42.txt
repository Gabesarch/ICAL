Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It directly references the specific apple instances, eliminating unnecessary steps such as going to the countertop. It also includes a conditional check to avoid opening the fridge if it's already open, which is not present in the original script. The revised script is better structured with comments explaining each step, which aligns with the dialogue instructions to place both apples in the fridge, including the one in the microwave and the one on the table edge. The original script lacks clarity and structure, with redundant actions like opening the fridge twice and placing the apple on the countertop before putting it in the fridge. The revised script corrects these inefficiencies and provides a clear, commented flow of actions.
