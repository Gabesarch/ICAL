Explanation: The revised script is significantly different from the original demonstration script. It follows the dialogue instructions more closely by only interacting with the objects necessary to make a salad, such as the knife, lettuce, potato, and plate. It removes unnecessary actions like slicing bread, which was not part of the Commander's instructions. The revised script also includes additional checks and actions to ensure the microwave is off before opening it and to clean the plate if it's dirty before assembling the salad. Furthermore, the revised script is better structured and commented, making it more readable and easier to understand. It uses the object instances provided in the initial state correctly, such as "Knife_67" for the knife on the shelf, "Lettuce_45" for the lettuce on the dining table, and "Plate_4" for the plate on the chair, which aligns with the Commander's instructions. It also corrects the logic for cooking the potato slices in the microwave and placing them on the plate, ensuring all salad components are on the plate as instructed.
