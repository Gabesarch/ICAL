Explanation: The revised script is significantly more efficient and readable than the original demonstration script. It removes unnecessary actions, such as moving the soap bottle and repeatedly placing and picking up the knife, which are not relevant to the task of making a salad. The revised script also includes comments that clearly describe each step of the process, improving readability. It directly addresses the task by cleaning the plate only if it's dirty, slicing the required vegetables, cooking the potato slices, and assembling the salad on the plate. The revised script uses the `check_attribute` method to conditionally clean the plate, and it correctly initializes new sliced objects from their respective parent objects for the lettuce, tomato, and potato, which is more aligned with the dialogue instructions. Additionally, it ensures the potato slices are cooked before placing them on the plate, which was not handled correctly in the original script. Overall, the revised script is more concise, logically structured, and adheres closely to the Commander's instructions for preparing the salad.
