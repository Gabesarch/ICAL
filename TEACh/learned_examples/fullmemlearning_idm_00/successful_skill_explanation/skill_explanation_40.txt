Explanation: The revised script is more comprehensive and includes conditional checks to ensure the mug is clean and empty before making coffee, which the original script did not account for. It also corrects the object instance references (e.g., "Mug_68" instead of "Mug") and adds a check to turn off the faucet if it's on before cleaning the mug. The revised script includes detailed comments explaining each step, improving readability and understanding of the task flow. Additionally, it removes unnecessary steps such as toggling the faucet without using it and ensures the coffee machine is used to prepare coffee, aligning with the dialogue instructions. The revised script also places the mug on the countertop after preparing the coffee, completing the task as requested.
