Explanation: The revised script is more efficient and readable than the original. It removes unnecessary actions, such as interacting with potatoes and stove knobs, which are not relevant to the task. The revised script also includes comments that clearly define the purpose of each section, improving readability and understanding of the code's intent. It uses descriptive variable names that correspond to the objects' locations and states, making the script easier to follow. Additionally, the revised script correctly initializes new sliced bread objects and updates their "cooked" state after toasting, which aligns with the dialogue instructions. The assembly of sandwich components is streamlined by directly placing the lettuce and toasted bread slices onto the plate. Overall, the revised script is more concise, follows the dialogue instructions accurately, and enhances maintainability through better structure and documentation.
