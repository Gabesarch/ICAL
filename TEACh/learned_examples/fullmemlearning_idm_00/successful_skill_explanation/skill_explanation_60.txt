Explanation: The revised script is significantly streamlined and more focused on the task of making toast. It removes unnecessary interactions with the fridge and a knife that were present in the original script. The revised script also corrects the object instances to match the initial object state, such as using the correct knife and plate instances. It introduces comments to explain the purpose of each code block, enhancing readability and understanding of the task flow. The revised script directly slices the bread, toasts it, and places it on the plate, following the Commander's instructions precisely and efficiently without extraneous actions.
