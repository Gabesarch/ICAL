Explanation: The revised script is more concise and directly addresses the Commander's instructions by focusing solely on the task of moving the two sponges into the sink. It eliminates unnecessary interactions with the soap bottle and the faucet, which were not part of the Commander's request. The revised script also includes clear comments that explain the purpose of each action, enhancing readability and making it easier to understand the sequence of operations and their relevance to the task. Additionally, the revised script uses descriptive variable names for the sponges and the sink basin, which improves code clarity and maintainability.
