# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is picked up to slice the bread, which is necessary to create slices for toasting.
# The toaster is used to toast two slices of bread, fulfilling the requirement to toast slices for the sandwich.
# The lettuce is sliced to provide fresh ingredients for the sandwich.
# The plate is used to assemble the sandwich components, ensuring a clean and organized presentation.
