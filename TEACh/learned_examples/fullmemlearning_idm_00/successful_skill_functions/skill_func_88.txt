# Causal abstraction comments:
# The fridge is opened to access the potato, which is necessary for the task.
# The potato is placed in a clean pot with water, as boiling requires water.
# The stove burner is turned on to heat the pot, which cooks the potato.
# The potato's state is updated to 'cooked' to reflect the completion of the boiling process.
