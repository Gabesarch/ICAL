# Causal abstraction comments:
# The first sponge is picked up from the microwave because the Commander specified to start with that one.
# Both sponges are placed in the sink basin as per the Commander's instructions to put the two sponges into the sink.
# The sink basin is the designated location for the sponges, completing the task as requested.
