# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is retrieved from the fridge to slice the bread, which is necessary for making toast.
# The bread is sliced to create individual pieces that can be toasted.
# The toaster is used to toast a slice of bread, which is the main task of making a plate of toast.
# The plate is cleaned if dirty to provide a clean surface for the food.
# The toasted bread is placed on the clean plate to complete the task of making a plate of toast.
