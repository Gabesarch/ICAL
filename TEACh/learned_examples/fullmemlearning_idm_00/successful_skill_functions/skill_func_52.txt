# Causal abstraction comments:
# The potato is cooked in the microwave to fulfill the requirement of being cooked before slicing.
# The knife is used to slice the cooked potato into pieces, as instructed by the Commander.
# The plate is identified and used to hold the potato slices, completing the task of serving the potato.
