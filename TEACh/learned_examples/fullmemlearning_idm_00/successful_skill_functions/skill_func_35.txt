# Causal abstraction comments:
# The spoons are identified based on the Commander's instructions and their known locations.
# Each spoon is picked up from its location and placed in the drawer, fulfilling the task of organizing the spoons.
# The drawer is chosen as the destination for the spoons to keep them neatly stored as per the household norm.
