# Causal abstraction comments:
# The microwave is opened to access the apple inside, following the dialogue instruction to retrieve it.
# The fridge is checked for its open state to avoid unnecessary actions; it is opened only if needed.
# The apples are placed directly into the fridge, streamlining the process and adhering to the dialogue's request.
# The fridge is closed after placing the apples inside, completing the task neatly and efficiently.
