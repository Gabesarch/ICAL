# Causal abstraction comments:
# The bread is retrieved and sliced to create individual pieces that can be toasted.
# The toaster is used to toast the bread slices one at a time, as it can only toast one slice at a time.
# After toasting, each slice is removed from the toaster to make room for the next slice.
# The tomato is retrieved and sliced to add a fresh component to the toast.
# The lettuce is included as per the dialogue, adding another fresh component to the dish.
# The clean plate is used to assemble the final components, ensuring a presentable and ready-to-eat meal.
