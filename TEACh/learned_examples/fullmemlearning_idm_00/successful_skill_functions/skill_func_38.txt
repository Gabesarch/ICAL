# Causal abstraction comments:
# The faucet is turned off initially to prevent wasting water before cleaning begins.
# Each plate is checked for dirtiness to ensure only dirty plates are cleaned, which is efficient.
# The faucet is turned on to rinse the plates, and then turned off to conserve water after cleaning.
# Clean plates are placed on the countertop, which is assumed to be an appropriate location for clean dishes.
