# Causal abstraction comments:
# The fridge is opened to access the eggs inside, as indicated by the Commander.
# Each egg is picked up from its location and placed on the dining table, centralizing all eggs as requested.
# The script ensures that all eggs mentioned by the Commander are collected from the fridge, stove, and sink.
# The dining table is the designated location for the eggs, making it easier for the Commander to find them.
