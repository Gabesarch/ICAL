# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is retrieved from the fridge to slice the lettuce and tomato, which are essential components of the salad.
# The lettuce is sliced twice to provide enough components for the salad, as instructed.
# The tomato is sliced to add variety and flavor to the salad, and its state is updated to reflect this action.
# The dirty plate is cleaned to ensure a hygienic presentation of the salad, and its state is updated to clean.
# The salad components are assembled on the clean plate, following the instructions to include two slices of lettuce and one slice of tomato.
