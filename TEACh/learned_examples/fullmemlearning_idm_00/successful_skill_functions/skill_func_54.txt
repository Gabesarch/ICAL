# The cabinets specified by the Commander are opened to retrieve the dirty dishware.
# Each dirty dishware item is cleaned in the sink using the faucet and dish sponge, ensuring they are ready for use.
# The state of each dishware item is updated to reflect its cleanliness and filled status after the cleaning process.
# The cleaned dishware is placed on the countertop, keeping the kitchen organized.
# The faucet is checked and turned off if necessary to prevent water waste.
# The cabinets are closed after the task is completed, maintaining the tidiness of the kitchen.
