# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is used to slice the bread, which is necessary for toasting.
# The toaster is used to toast the bread slices, which is essential for making toast.
# The dirty plate is cleaned to ensure a hygienic surface for the food.
# The lettuce is sliced to provide a fresh component for the meal.
# The toasted bread and lettuce are placed on the plate to assemble the final dish.
