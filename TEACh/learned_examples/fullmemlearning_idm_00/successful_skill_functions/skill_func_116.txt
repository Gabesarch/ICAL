# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is retrieved from the microwave, which is necessary for slicing the bread.
# The bread is sliced to create a slice that can be toasted, as toasting requires individual slices.
# The toaster is used to toast the bread slice, which is the main task as per the dialogue instructions.
# The clean plate is used to hold the toasted bread slice, completing the task as requested by the Commander.
