# Causal abstraction comments:
# The bread is retrieved from the specified cabinet and sliced to create a piece suitable for toasting.
# The knife is used to slice the bread, which is necessary to fit it into the toaster.
# The toaster is used to toast the bread slice, fulfilling the requirement to make toast.
# The clean plate is identified and used to place the toasted bread slice, as instructed by the Commander.
