# Causal abstraction comments:
# The dish sponges are identified based on their locations as mentioned by the Commander: one on the chair and one in the fridge.
# Each sponge is picked up from its respective location and placed in the sink basin, fulfilling the task of gathering all dish sponges in the sink.
# The script ensures that all known dish sponges are moved to the sink, as per the Commander's instructions, completing the task for the day.
