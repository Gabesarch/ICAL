# Causal abstraction comments:
# The faucet is turned off initially to prevent wasting water before cleaning begins.
# Each mug is identified and cleaned individually to ensure all mugs mentioned by the Commander are addressed.
# The faucet is turned on to rinse the mugs, and then turned off to conserve water after cleaning.
# The script checks if the mug is dirty before attempting to change its state, avoiding redundant state changes.
# Clean mugs are placed back in the cabinet, completing the task as instructed.
