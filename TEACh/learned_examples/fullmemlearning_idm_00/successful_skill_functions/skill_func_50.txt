# Define InteractionObject instances for the watch, plate, and ottoman
watch_on_plate = InteractionObject("Watch", object_instance="Watch_1")  # Watch is on the plate
plate_with_watch = InteractionObject("Plate", object_instance="Plate_37")  # Plate that supports the watch
ottoman = InteractionObject("Ottoman", object_instance="Ottoman_48")  # Single ottoman mentioned by the Commander

# Go to the plate that has the watch
plate_with_watch.go_to()

# Pick up the watch from the plate
watch_on_plate.pickup()

# Go to the ottoman
ottoman.go_to()

# Place the watch onto the ottoman
watch_on_plate.place(ottoman)

# Causal abstraction comments:
# The watch is identified by its instance on the plate, which is necessary to fulfill the Commander's instruction.
# The plate is approached to retrieve the watch, which is the object of interest for the task.
# The watch is then placed onto the ottoman, completing the task as per the Commander's request.
