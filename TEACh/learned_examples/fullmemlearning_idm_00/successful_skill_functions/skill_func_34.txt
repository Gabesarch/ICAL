# Causal abstraction comments:
# The mug is identified on the chair and picked up to ensure we are using the correct object as per the Commander's instructions.
# The mug's cleanliness is checked, and if necessary, it is cleaned in the sink basin to meet the requirement of using a clean mug.
# The coffee machine is used to prepare coffee, which is the main task assigned by the Commander.
# The mug is placed on the countertop after coffee preparation, completing the task as requested.
