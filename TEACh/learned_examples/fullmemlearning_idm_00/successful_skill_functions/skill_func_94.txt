# Causal abstraction comments:
# The robot selects the specified mug to the left of the fridge on the counter as instructed by the Commander.
# The mug's filled state is checked, and if necessary, it is emptied in the sink basin before using it to prepare coffee.
# The coffee machine is used to prepare coffee, which is the main task assigned by the Commander.
# The mug is placed on the countertop after coffee preparation, completing the task as requested.
