# Causal abstraction comments:
# The microwave is opened to retrieve the lettuce, which is necessary for slicing.
# The knife is picked up from the countertop to slice the lettuce, as instructed by the Commander.
# A clean plate is retrieved from the cupboard next to the stove to place the lettuce slice on it, following the Commander's instructions for cleanliness and location.
