# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is picked up from the fridge to slice the tomato.
# The bowl is cleaned in the sink to ensure hygiene before placing food in it. The state of the bowl is updated to reflect it is clean and filled with water.
# The water is poured out from the bowl to make space for the tomato slices, after checking that the bowl is indeed filled.
# The tomato is sliced into five pieces, as per the instruction.
# Each tomato slice is placed in the clean bowl, fulfilling the task of serving five slices of tomato.
