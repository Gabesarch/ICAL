# Causal abstraction comments:
# The mug is identified on the stool by the toaster and picked up to ensure we are using the correct object as per the Commander's instructions.
# Before attempting to wash the mug, its state is checked to see if it is dirty. If it is not dirty, the washing step is skipped.
# The faucet's state is checked, and if it is on, it is turned off to prevent water waste before washing the mug.
# The mug is washed in the sink basin to meet the requirement of using a clean mug for coffee preparation.
# The dirty cup in the coffee maker is removed and placed in the sink to clear the way for the clean mug.
# The coffee machine is used to prepare coffee, and after the coffee is prepared, the mug's state is updated to reflect that it is filled with coffee, completing the task as instructed by the Commander.
