# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is picked up to slice the bread, which is necessary to create slices for toasting.
# The toaster is used to toast two slices of bread, fulfilling the requirement to toast slices for the sandwich.
# The tomato is sliced to provide fresh ingredients for the sandwich.
# The plate is checked for cleanliness and cleaned if necessary, ensuring a hygienic surface for sandwich assembly.
# The sandwich components are assembled on the plate, completing the task as per the dialogue instructions.
