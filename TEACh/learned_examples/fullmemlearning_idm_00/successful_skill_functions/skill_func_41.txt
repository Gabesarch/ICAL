# Causal abstraction comments:
# The mugs are identified by their unique object instances to ensure the correct objects are being interacted with.
# The cabinet is opened only if it is not already open to avoid unnecessary actions.
# Each mug is placed into the cabinet, fulfilling the Commander's instruction to place them into a single cabinet.
# The cabinet is closed after placing the mugs inside, completing the task neatly.
