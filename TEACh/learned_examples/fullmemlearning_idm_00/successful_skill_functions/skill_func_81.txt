# Causal abstraction comments:
# The knife is retrieved from the fridge to slice the bread, which is necessary for making toast.
# The bread is sliced to create individual pieces that can be toasted.
# The toaster is used to toast a slice of bread, which is the main task of making a slice of toast.
# The clean plate is used to serve the toasted bread, completing the task as requested by the Commander.
