<Driver> Hello! What shall I do today? <Commander> We're making a salad. <Commander> There is lettuce under the sink. <Commander> The knife is in the fridge. <Commander> We need 2 slices of lettuce. <Commander> Now cook a slice of potato. <Driver> I have sliced the lettuce. <Driver> ok. <Commander> It's on the chair on the other side of the island. <Commander> Clean the plate to the right of the stove. <Commander> Put the potato and the two lettuce slices on the plate. <Driver> Done :). <Commander> That's it. Thanks!
