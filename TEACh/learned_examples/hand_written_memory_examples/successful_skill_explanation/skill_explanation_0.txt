Looking at the demonstration scripts, it is evident that the code should pick up a knife to slice the lettuce. Then, then two lettuce slice instances is instantiated and each slice is picked up and placed on a plate by the agent. The demonstration script does this, but includes extra steps of picking up a tomato and putting it down, which is not relevant to the task. This part of the program should be removed. The code is not well commented, and comments should be added for readability.
