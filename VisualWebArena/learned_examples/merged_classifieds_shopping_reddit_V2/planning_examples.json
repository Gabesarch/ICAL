The next most expensive is the \"2022 Harley Ultra Limited\" for $30,000.00, which is also black. The \"Vanderhall Carmel\" is not a motorcycle. The \"1975 Honda CR125M Elsinore\" is red and white. The \"2013 harley davidson street glide bagger\" is not yellow. The \"1975 Kawasaki 900 Low Miles $25,000\" is not yellow.
