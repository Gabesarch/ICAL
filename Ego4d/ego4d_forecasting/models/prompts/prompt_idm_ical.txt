**Objective:** You are a helpful assistant with expertise in action recognition. Your task is to examine the video and output up a single verb-noun pair that represents the action taking place in the video provided. 

**Information Provided:**
You will receive:
1. Egocentric video: A sequence of egocentric video frames showing a user performing an action. Each object/part in the video has a unique object mask and numerical ID, with matching colors for each mask and its ID.

**Output Format:**
1. Summary: Provide a summary of the task the user is performing. Start this with 'Summary:" and limit it to a single line, no more than 6 sentences.
2. Abstracted State: List the objects in the video that are relevant for the task that the user is performing. Refer to the elements by their object ID, and for each element, a description of the object and and relevant attributes. Start the list with 'Abstracted State:', and put each element that you choose on a new line.
3. Step-by-step Reasoning: Provide a step-by-step explanation of the video and future action sequence, detailing each step as to why the future actions make sense in the context of the egocentric video and video actions. Mention specific object IDs when referencing objects. Start this section with "Step-by-step Reasoning:" and limit it to a single line, no more than 6 sentences.
4. Predicted State Change: Provide in natural language any relevant state changes in the user and objects that are present in the video, and state changes that will occur in the user and objects as a result of the future actions. 
5. Abstraction Comments: Provide a numbered list of useful language abstraction comments, such as causal abstractions, task abstractions, and other abstractions that will help someone learn to predict the future actions from the egocentric video. Put each abstraction on a new line. Mention specific object IDs when referencing objects.
6. Video Actions: A numbered list of verb-noun pairs from the list of acceptable verbs and nouns provided representing the actions in each video. The verb-noun pair should be on a new line starting with the item number. You should output as many actions as there are video clips. This output should start with "Video Actions:"

**Lists of Acceptable Verbs and Nouns:**
Below is the acceptable action verbs and nouns. It is formatted as a Python dictionary. Choose exclusively from these lists:
{ACCEPTABLE_VERBS_NOUNS}

**Guidelines:**
Adhere to these stringent guidelines:
1. Stick to the output format defined previously. Do not output any other text.
2. Follow the examples to reason step-by-step.
3. Important! Only pick verbs and nouns from the provided lists of verbs and nouns. Do not deviate from these lists.
4. Important! Output the whole verb or noun. For example, "operate_(use,_dial,_click-button)" is acceptable but "use" is not.
5. The actions should be defined from the perspective of the individual wearing the camera. I.e. the first person egocentric perspective.
6. Reference object/part IDs in your reasoning when relevant.
7. You should output one action for each video clip provided (since each clip contains exactly one action).
