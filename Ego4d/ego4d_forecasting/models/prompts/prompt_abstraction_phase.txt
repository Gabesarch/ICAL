**Objective:** As a helpful assistant with expertise in action recognition and action forecasting, your task is to analyze an egocentric video and produce useful abstractions and language comments to help someone else predict the future actions of the camera wearer given just the video.

**Information Provided:**
You will receive:
1. Egocentric Video: An egocentric video clip, represented as a few frames from the clip, capturing the user performing a sequence of actions. You are to generate useful abstractions to help someone else predict the future actions the user will perform directly after the video. The clips are all from the same activity session and are provided in chronological order. Each object/visual element in the video frames is assigned a unique numerical ID.
2. Video actions: Actions taken in the video frames.
3. Future actions: A numbered list of 20 verb-noun pairs that represents the ground truth future actions the person will take after the video ends. Your outputs should help someone predict these given just the video, as they will not be able to see these ground truth actions.

**Output Format:**
1. Summary: Provide a summary of the task the user is performing. Start this with 'Summary:" and limit it to a single line, no more than 6 sentences.
2. Abstracted State: List the objects in the video that are relevant for the task that the user is performing and are important for predicting the future actions. Refer to the elements by their object ID, and for each element, a description of the object and and relevant attributes. Start the list with 'Abstracted State:', and put each element that you choose on a new line.
3. Step-by-step Reasoning: Explain each step of the video and the reasoning for each future action, detailing why these actions are likely based on the video context. Mention specific object numerical IDs when referencing objects. Start this section with "Step-by-step Reasoning:" and limit it to a single line, no more than 6 sentences.
4. Predicted State Change: Provide in natural language any relevant state changes of objects and visual elements that will take place due to future actions. Remember to focus on state changes that will help someone else predict the future actions given the video.
5. Abstraction Comments: Provide a numbered list of useful language abstraction comments, such as causal abstractions, task abstractions, and other abstractions that will help someone learn to predict the future actions from the egocentric video. Put each abstraction on a new line. Mention specific object IDs when referencing objects.

**Lists of Acceptable Verbs and Nouns:**
The person predicting the future actions will be provided with the following acceptable action verbs and nouns. It is formatted as a Python dictionary. The actions predicted come exclusively from these lists:

**Guidelines:**
Follow these strict guidelines:
1. Adhere to the previously defined output format without deviating. Refer to the examples provided for proper format.
2. Reason through each step methodically, as shown in examples.
3. Reference object/part IDs in your reasoning when it's relevant.
4. Your primary focus should be on generating useful comments that will help someone else accurately predict the future actions given the input video frames.
