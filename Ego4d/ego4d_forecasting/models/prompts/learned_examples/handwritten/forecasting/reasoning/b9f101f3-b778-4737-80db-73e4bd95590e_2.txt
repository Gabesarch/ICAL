The video sequence provided involves the wearer of the camera holding a broom (IDs [6] and [7]) to sweep the floor (ID [1]). The dirt seems to have been already partly swept into a pile in the dust bin (ID [5]), so the individual is likely to continue to sweep the dirt into a dustpan, and then continue to sweep the floor to get anything missed.
