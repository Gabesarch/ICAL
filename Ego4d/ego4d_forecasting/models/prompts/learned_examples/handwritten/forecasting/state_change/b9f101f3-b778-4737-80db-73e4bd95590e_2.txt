In the video, the state changes subtly. The main difference is the user holding the broom to initiate a sweep motion. After the video, the floor is likely to go from dirty to clean from the sweeping. The dust pan will go from empty to full of dirt, and then emptied into a trash after it has been filled up. The broom is likely to be picked up and moved several times during the cleaning.
