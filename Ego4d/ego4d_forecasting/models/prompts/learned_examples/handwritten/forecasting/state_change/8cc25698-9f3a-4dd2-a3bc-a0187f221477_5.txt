In the video, the dough changes shape due to the user in the video molding the dough. After the video, the user may put on flour to make the dough less sticky. A knife may be picked up by the user and the dough may be cut into pieces, whereas before it was one whole piece. The dough may be molded further to again change the shape, and finally placed in a new location.
