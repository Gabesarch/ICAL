After the video, the screw will likely be drilled into the wood, causing a state change of the screw secured in the wood. The drill is starting out resting outside the view of the user but will be picked up by the user and turned on to put the screw in the wood. The wood will likely be moved to a new location after drilling.",

Pay attention to what is in the user's hand and where the user is looking in the video. For example, here the user is clearly holding a piece of wood, and thus is likely screwing into the wood and building something with it.\n3. There are other objects surrounding the user, such as a ladder. However, this doesn't seem to be directly relevant to the task in this case. Some items in the peripheral view may or may not be relevant for the action prediction.\n4. Although I do not directly see a drill in the video, I predicted a drill to be used later since a screw is being placed in the wood. "
