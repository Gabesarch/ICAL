1. It is necessary for the screw to be picked up and put on the wood before drilling into the wood.
2. Pay attention to what is in the user's hand and where the user is looking in the video. For example, here the user is clearly holding a piece of wood, and thus is likely screwing into the wood and building something with it.
3. There are other objects surrounding the user, such as a ladder. However, this doesn't seem to be directly relevant to the task in this case. Some items in the peripheral view may or may not be relevant for the action prediction.
4. Although I do not directly see a drill in the video, I predicted a drill to be used later since a screw is being placed in the wood.
