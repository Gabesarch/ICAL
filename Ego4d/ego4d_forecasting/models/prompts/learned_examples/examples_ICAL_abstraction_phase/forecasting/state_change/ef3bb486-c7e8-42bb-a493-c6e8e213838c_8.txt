The sponge goes from dry to wet as it is dipped into the soapy water. After the video, the car will go from dirty to clean as it is washed. The sponge will be squeezed, releasing soapy water, and then reapplied to the car's surface. The hose may be turned on and off, changing from a resting state to an active state as water is sprayed.
