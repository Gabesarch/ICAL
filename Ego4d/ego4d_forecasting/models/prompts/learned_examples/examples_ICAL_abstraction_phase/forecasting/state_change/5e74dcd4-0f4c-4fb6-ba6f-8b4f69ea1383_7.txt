The lid will change from being unsecured to secured on the device. The screws will be tightened or loosened, altering their state from loose to tight or vice versa. The user may open the lid to access the interior of the device, and then close it after the necessary actions are taken. Tools like the drill and wrench will be picked up, used, and then placed back down, changing their state from at rest to in use.
